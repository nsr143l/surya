# prompt.zsh - My prompt-specific configuration for zsh

# Usage
#   Source this file.
#
# Notes
#   I use a 3rd-party prompt called 'pure' by sindresorhus. A while back I
#   forked it to add features related to configuring the colors of various
#   elements of the prompt, as well as to modify bits related to how the Git
#   statuses are reported.
#
#   You can find the source code online here[1], and the original fork here[2].
#
#   For this to work, you'll have to make sure that the 'pure' prompt plugin is
#   in your zsh 'fpath' somewhere. In particular, I set my fpath (in ~/.zshenv)
#   to include the folder ~/.zfunctions/, which is the folder where the clone
#   of [1] resides.

# Using ^L by default will hide the first line of my prompt (with the pwd).
# Also, in tmux, ^L means "move to pane to the left"
# We rebind ^Y here so that it just runs 'clear', which fixes both problems
